    <h1>12 must-reads on climate change – as submitted by you</h1><hr>

    <p>That’s Mark Lynas, writing in “Six Degrees: Our Future on a Hotter Planet.”

        It’s a true if disturbing prediction.
        
        By some accounts, we’ve already entered the Anthropocene, an epoch defined by human degradation of the natural world. We’re causing extinctions, changing the climate. Mother Nature is still powerful, sure. But, as Lynas explains, we humans are so fundamental a force that we are changing the way she works.
        
        I recently asked readers of my “2 degrees” newsletter (sign up here) to suggest “must-read” books on climate change – and Lynas’ important work of nonfiction was among your top recommendations. I’ve been reading it, and I recently interviewed the author. The book takes a degree-by-degree look at the future of our planet as it continues to warm. Two degrees of warming, which the international community is trying to avoid, and which is the focus of my climate change initiative at CNN, sounds bad. But, as Lynas told me, a world that’s 6 degrees warmer than before the industrial revolution, which is possible if we keep burning alarming amounts of fossil fuels and chopping down forests, sounds downright hellish.
        
        You’ll find Lynas’ “Six Degrees” on a list of 12 climate change must-reads below. It includes a Pulitzer Prize winner, Elizabeth Kolbert’s “The Sixth Extinction,” as well as an illustrated account of an artist’s dive into climate science, titled “Climate Changed.”</p>
