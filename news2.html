    <h1>Night owls may have unhealthy habits that lead to early death, study says</h1><hr>
    <p>When the study originally began, each twin was asked to pick one answer from the following questions: I am clearly a morning person; I am to some extent a morning person; I am clearly an evening person; or I am to some extent an evening person.

        Only about 10% of the twins described themselves as definite evening people, while 33% said they somewhat preferred staying up late. Over 29% were clearly morning people, while another 27.7% described themselves as somewhat inclined to prefer mornings.
        
        For the new study, researchers looked at death records of a subset (8,728 participants) of the original study. After adjusting the data to account for educational level, use of alcohol, smoking, the level of body mass, and sleep duration, the study found that being a night owl increased the risk of an early death by about 9% compared with morning types, who are often called early birds.
        
        “We have known for a long time that those who have an evening type preference are more likely to be heavier drinkers, have alcohol use disorder and are also more likely to use other substances including tobacco,” said Dr. Bhanu Prakash Kolla, a sleep medicine specialist in the Center for Sleep Medicine at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who was not involved in the study.
        
        However, a 9% increased risk of early death is significant, he added, leaving room for other ways being an evening type could increase the risk of mortality.
        
        “Other possible causes that come to mind include those who are evening types will likely need to wake up early for work/school therefore end up getting less sleep and the sleep deprivation can increase risk,” Kolla said in an email.
