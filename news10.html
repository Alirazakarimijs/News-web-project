    <h1>Why five women embarked on a 3,500-mile skateboard journey across Europe
        By Amy Woodyatt, CNN</h1><hr>

        <p> 
            On nothing but a “plank of wood and four wheels,” a group of women are careering down windy mountain roads at breakneck speed, constantly on the lookout for stones, turns and oncoming traffic.
            
            For most people, this could sound less than relaxing – even terrifying. But for Anna Pixner, downhill skateboarding at speed evokes a different feeling: freedom.
            
            Austrian Pixner has been riding concrete like surfers ride waves for six years. When she started competing, she would stand out in crowds of hundreds of men as one of a dozen women. Journalists and spectators are still quick to point out that she is an exception to the norm in the male-dominated world of downhill skateboarding, but Pixner has tired of such comments.
            
            “There’s not that much of a difference except that we unfortunately started a bit later because I think we were missing the inspiration … if there are no role models, if you never saw a woman doing that, it’s harder to get the idea to do that,” she explains to CNN Sport, adding that, for a long time, she had no idea the sport even existed.</p>
