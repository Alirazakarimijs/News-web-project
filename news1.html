         — 
        Tropical Cyclone Biparjoy has made landfall in India’s western Gujarat state, close to the Pakistan border, unleashing powerful gusts of wind that ripped up trees and toppled electricity poles.
        
        At landfall, Biparjoy was equivalent to a strong tropical storm with winds of 65 mph (100 kph), according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.
        
        As it moves slowly inland, the winds and storm surge threats are expected to diminish, with flooding becoming the most significant impact for millions of people over the next 48 hours.
        
        Heavy rainfall warnings are expected to remain in place for northwest India through Saturday. Rainfall of 150 to 250 mm (6 to 10 inches) is likely with isolated amounts up to 500 mm (20 inches) possible.
